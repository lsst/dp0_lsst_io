.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Review the style guide to keep a consistent approach to the documentation.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the page.

The following exercises are designed as a usability and functionality test
of the Portal Aspect of the Rubin Science Platform (RSP;
`data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud/>`_).
The goal is to understand how users interact with the Portal and identify
areas that may require improvement.
These exercises were also designed serve also as challenged-based
learning opportunities, complementary to the `Documentation and tutorials`_.

**Who can participate?**
Anyone with an RSP account at `data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud/>`_.

**How to participate?**
There are six exercises to choose from, two each at the beginner,
intermediate, and experienced levels.
Choose an exercise (use the table of contents at upper right),
work through it, then complete the `Feedback form`_.
The entire process should not take more than 25 minutes per exercise,
and might be much faster depending on RSP experience.

**Resources.**
First try the exercise on its own, then use any of these resources
which are relevant.
The `DP0.2 documentation <http://dp0-2_lsst_io>`_,
`DP0.2 schema browser <https://dm.lsst.org/sdm_schemas/browser/dp02.html>`_,
and `DP0.2 Portal tutorials <https://dp0-2.lsst.io/tutorials-examples/index.html#portal-tutorials>`_.
The `DP0.3 documentation <http://dp0-3_lsst_io>`_,
`DP0.3 schema browser <https://dm.lsst.org/sdm_schemas/browser/dp03.html>`_,
and `DP0.3 Portal tutorials <https://dp0-3.lsst.io/tutorials-dp0-3/index.html>`_.

.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-Form:

=============
Feedback form 
=============

Thank you for completing the form, your feedback is essential and will be
used by the Rubin Community Science team (CST) to design processes to
scientifically validate the RSP and enhance user experience.

The same form is used for all exercises.

Each exercise should take no more than 20 minutes; if it is taking
longer, go to the feedback form and note that it couldn't be finished
in the time.

The feedback form is not anonymous and collects email addresses, so that
CST members may follow-up in some cases.

.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-1:

=====================
Exercise 1 (beginner)
=====================

Navigate in a web browser to `data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud>`_
and log in to the Portal Aspect.

Retrieve the ``g_psfFlux``, ``g_calibFlux``, and the ``g_extendedness`` columns
from the DP0.2 Object catalog for objects within 15 arcminutes of the galaxy cluster
at Right Ascension 55.75 degrees and Declination -32.27 degrees.
Plot the ``psfFlux`` vs. the ``calibFlux`` flux columns.
In the results table, impose a constraint to only plot objects with extendedness
equal to 1.
Change the plot symbols to open circles. 

**Reminder:**
If this takes more than 20 minutes in this task, in the feedback form please mark
it as "could not be completed" and indicate how far you got.

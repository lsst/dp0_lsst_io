.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Review the style guide to keep a consistent approach to the documentation.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the page.

The following exercises are designed as a usability and functionality test
of the Portal Aspect of the Rubin Science Platform (RSP;
`data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud/>`_).
The goal is to understand how users interact with the Portal and identify
areas that may require improvement.
These exercises were also designed serve also as challenged-based
learning opportunities, complementary to the :ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Get-Started-Docs-and-Tuts`.

**Who can participate?**
Anyone with an RSP account at `data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud/>`_.

**How to participate?**
There are six exercises to choose from, two each at the beginner,
intermediate, and experienced levels.
Choose an exercise (use the table of contents at upper right),
work through it, then complete the :ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-Form`.
The entire process should not take more than 25 minutes per exercise,
and might be much faster depending on RSP experience.

**Resources.**
First, try the exercise on its own, then use any of these resources
which are relevant.
The `DP0.2 documentation <http://dp0-2_lsst_io>`_,
`DP0.2 schema browser <https://dm.lsst.org/sdm_schemas/browser/dp02.html>`_,
and `DP0.2 Portal tutorials <https://dp0-2.lsst.io/tutorials-examples/index.html#portal-tutorials>`_.

`Portal usability test answer key <https://dp0-2.lsst.io/tutorials-examples/portal-usabilitytest-answerkey.html>`_.


.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-Form:

=============
Feedback form
=============

Thank you for completing the form, your feedback is essential and will be
used by the Rubin Community Science Team (CST) to design processes to
scientifically validate the RSP and enhance user experience.

The same form is used for all exercises.

Each exercise should take no more than 20 minutes; if it is taking
longer, go to the feedback form and note that it couldn't be finished
in the time.

The feedback form is not anonymous and collects email addresses, so that
CST members may follow up in some cases.

.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-1:

=====================
Exercise 1 (beginner)
=====================

Navigate in a web browser to `data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud/>`_
and log in to the Portal Aspect.

Retrieve the ``g_psfFlux``, ``g_calibFlux``, and the ``g_extendedness`` columns
from the DP0.2 Object catalog for objects within 15 arcminutes of the galaxy cluster
at Right Ascension 55.75 degrees and Declination -32.27 degrees.
Plot the ``psfFlux`` vs. the ``calibFlux`` flux columns.
In the results table, impose a constraint to only plot objects with extendedness
equal to 1.
Change the plot symbols to open circles.

**Reminder:**
If this takes more than 20 minutes in this task, in the feedback form please mark
it as "could not be completed" in the feedback form and indicate how far you got.

:ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-Form`.


.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-2:

=====================
Exercise 2 (beginner)
=====================

Create a ``g-r`` color vs. ``i`` magnitude diagram using the ``calibFlux`` columns in the DP0.2 Object catalog,
for all objects within 120 arcseconds of Right Ascension 60 degrees and Declination -35 degrees.
Zoom in on the clump of points with color values approximately in the range of -4 < ``g-r`` < 4.
Save the plot as a PNG file to your local computer. **Hint**: After retrieving the ``{band}_calibFlux`` columns,
use the expression ``(-2.5*log10({band}_calibFlux) + 31.4)`` to convert the fluxes in nanoJankys to magnitudes in the AB system. 

**Reminder**:
If this takes more than 20 minutes in this task, in the feedback form please mark
it as "could not be completed" in the feedback form and indicate how far you got.

:ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-Form`

.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-3:

=====================
Exercise 3 (intermediate)
=====================

Retrieve the four DP0.2 processed visit images (PVI), also known as "calexp" images, obtained with LSST band ``i``,
before the date of ``MJD 59840``, whose boundaries contain the point with Right Ascension 55.75 degrees
and Declination -32.27 degrees. In the results view, choose the option to display the images in a grid.
Use the "Image center drop down" tool to center the first displayed image on the search coordinates.
Use the "Image alignment drop down" tool to align and lock all displayed images by the World Coordinate System (WCS)
and zoom-in 3 times.

**Reminder**:
If this takes more than 20 minutes in this task, in the feedback form please mark
it as "could not be completed" in the feedback form and indicate how far you got.

:ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-Form`

.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-4:

=====================
Exercise 4 (intermediate)
=====================

Use the ADQL interface to obtain, from the DP0.2 DiaSource table, an ``r``-band light curve for the Type Ia supernova
which has a ``diaObjectId`` of ``1250953961339360185``. Retrieve the ``r``-band fluxes and their errors derived from
a linear least-squares fit of a PSF model, and the effective mid-exposure time, for all ``diaSources`` associated
with this ``diaObjectId``. Plot the light curve as the flux as a function of time, with error bars associated with
each flux point. Change the plot style to use connected points, the point style to be red circles, and then sort the
results by ``midPointTai``. Update the plot axes labels to be "PSF Difference-Image Flux" and "MJD of the Exposure Midpoint".
Save the plot as a PNG file to your local computer. **Hint**: In the ADQL query, the filter name will need to be
formatted as a string (e.g., ``'r'``). 

**Reminder**:
If this takes more than 20 minutes in this task, in the feedback form please mark
it as "could not be completed" in the feedback form and indicate how far you got.

.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-5:

=====================
Exercise 5 (experienced)
=====================

The first figure below, which corresponds to Figure 15 from
`The LSST DESC DC2 Simulated Sky Survey <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...31L/abstract>`_ paper,
has three panels: the grid of tracts in the DC2 simulation area on the left, the image of tract ``3828`` on the center,
and a zoom-in image approximately centered near a particularly bright elongated galaxy on the right.
The galaxy is located at Right Ascension = 3h46m56.21s and Declination = -36d05m27.7s (EQ_J2000). Use the
Portal Aspect of the RSP to reproduce the second figure below, which shows an image of the same galaxy
in the ``r`` band, including:

* The compass with cardinal points (N-E compass)
* The footprint of the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 - Infrared channel (WFC3/IR)
* The extraction of a light profile of the galaxy. Save the light profile as a CSV file.

**Hint**: Use a color stretch "Linear: Stretch -1 Sigma to 30 Sigma‚Äù to resemble the second figure below. 

**Reminder**:
If this takes more than 20 minutes in this task, in the feedback form please mark
it as "could not be completed" in the feedback form and indicate how far you got.

:ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-Form`

.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Exercises-6:

=====================
Exercise 6 (experienced)
=====================

Query the DP0.2 Object catalog for the galaxy cluster around Right Ascension 3h43m00.00s and Declination -32d16m19.00s
to visualize the region where the cluster is and plot the "red sequence" in a color-magnitude diagram
(for example, ``r-i`` vs ``i``), as illustrated in the first image below.  Then, select the points in the red
sequence to highlight the cluster members in the image, as shown in the second image below. **Hint 1**: use a
search radius of 200 arcseconds. **Hint 2**: you can use the ``scisql_nanojanskyToAbMag`` SQL function to convert
fluxes to magnitudes (filter out negative fluxes before using the function). 

**Definition**: The red sequence in galaxy clusters refers to a tight correlation observed in color-magnitude diagrams, where many of the galaxies in a cluster show a similar red color and brightness, indicating they are older, more evolved galaxies with less star formation.

**Reminder**:
If this takes more than 20 minutes in this task, in the feedback form please mark
it as "could not be completed" in the feedback form and indicate how far you got.

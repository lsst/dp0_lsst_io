.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Review the style guide to keep a consistent approach to the documentation.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Support:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the page.

Several venues are provided to support DP0 and RSP users, as described below.

If you're unsure which venue to use, `make a new topic <https://community.lsst.org/t/how-to-make-a-new-topic/8197>`__
in the Rubin Community Forum's `Support category <https://community.lsst.org/c/support>`__.

There is no wrong place to post questions or requests for assistance, so please don't hestitate.
Hearing about issues and receiving feedback from users is important to Rubin Observatory staff.

This subcategory is monitored by the Rubin Observatory `Community Science team (CST) <https://community.lsst.org/g/CST>`_.

**Instructions:**
`Ask a question in the Forum <https://community.lsst.org/t/how-to-ask-a-question-in-the-forum/8198>`__,

.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Support-Forum-Service:

------------------------------------------------
Minor or ambiguous RSP service and access issues
------------------------------------------------

Please feel free to post even small questions as new topics in the "Support - RSP Service Issues" subcategory of the Community Forum.

This subcategory provides a place to determine if others are experiencing the same technical issue (e.g., *"is this local or general network outage?"*,
*"my query is taking a long time, is this a real problem or did I do it wrong?"*),
and to crowd-source solutions to technical issues from each other when possible.


.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Support-Github:

======================================
Technical assistance via GitHub issues
======================================

Bug reports, persistent technical issues, and requests for new features or for global installations of commonly used software packages can be submitted
as GitHub issues in the `rubin-dp0 GitHub Organization's Support repository <https://github.com/rubin-dp0/Support>`_.

**Instructions:**
In the horizontal menu bar at the top of that page, click on the “Issues” option (with the circled dot icon),
then choose the green “New Issue” button at right.
Next to either “Bug report” or "Feature request" choose “Get started” (as appropriate for your case), and fill in the title and contents of your issue.
In the right side-menu, do adjust the labels as appropriate, but leave the other options.
Click “Submit new issue” when you’re ready.
These issues will be addressed by Rubin Observatory staff.



.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Support-Live:

====================================
Live support during virtual seminars
====================================

Bring your questions to the :ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Virtual-Events-Assemblies`.
The "drop-in" type assemblies will have more time for Q&A than assemblies with a tutorial or presentation,
but Rubin Observatory staff members will always be in attendance and able to assist you.

.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Review the style guide to keep a consistent approach to the documentation.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Get-Started:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the page.

**DP0 delegates** are the scientists and students who have accounts in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP)
at `data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud/>`__ and access to the Data Preview 0 (DP0) data sets.

Becoming a delegate and accessing the DP0 data is as easy as following the checklist below
and getting an account in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP).

There is no application process.
The only prerequisite is to be a Rubin data rights holder (see the `Rubin Data Policy <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/RDO-013>`__).
The number of delegates is currently limited to 900.
Space is available and all petitions are being accepted.
If that changes this page will be updated.


.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Get-Started-Checklist:

======================
New delegate checklist
======================

**Step 1.**

.. Review the :ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Participation-Guidelines`.

**Step 2.**
Submit a petition for an account in Rubin Science Platform (RSP) using the
instructions on `how to get an RSP account <https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/getting-started/get-an-account.html>`_.

Everyone should use their full professional names and institutional email addresses.
The process to verify data rights and approve petitions can take a few days.
Please contact Melissa Graham at mlg3k@uw.edu or Heather Shaughnessy at sheather@slac.stanford.edu with any issues.
Once your petition is approved and you can log in to `data.lsst.cloud <https://data.lsst.cloud>`_, you are a DP0 delegate.

**Step 3.**
Get an account in the `Rubin Community Forum <https://community.lsst.org/>`__ and review how to :ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Get-Support` for DP0.

It is recommended to go to `community.lsst.org/groups <https://community.lsst.org/groups>`_ and join the "DP0 Delegates" group.
DP0-related news and events are shared with this group.
Opt-in to receiving email notifications from the Forum by setting the profile preference for "Email me when I am sent a personal message" to "Always".
People new to the Rubin Community Forum might appreciate

.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-Get-Started-Activities:

======================
Recommended activities
======================

All DP0 delegates are encouraged to use the documentation and tutorials to learn how to use the RSP to access and analyze LSST data,
and to generate and test custom software to prepare for when *real commissioning data* are released as Data Preview 1 (DP1) and DP2
(see the `plans for early science with Rubin Observatory <https://www.lsst.org/scientists/early-science>`__).

**Review documentation:** the data product definitions are available for the
`DP0.2 <https://dp0-2.lsst.io/data-products-dp0-2/index.html#dp0-2-data-products-definition-document-dpdd>`__ and
`DP0.3 <https://dp0-3.lsst.io/data-products-dp0-3/index.html#dp0-3-data-products-definition-document-dpdd>`__ releases.

**Do tutorials:** follow `step-by-step introductions <https://dp0-2.lsst.io/data-access-analysis-tools/index.html#data-access-and-analysis-tools>`__
to the Portal, Notebook, and Application Programming Interface (API) Aspects of the RSP,
or work through the `DP0.2 Tutorials <https://dp0-2.lsst.io/tutorials-examples/index.html>`__ or `DP0.3 Tutorials <https://dp0-3.lsst.io/tutorials-dp0-3/index.html>`__.

**Attend virtual seminars:** the Rubin Science Assemblies take place every Thursday morning at 9am Pacific time,
and feature announcements, tutorials, presentations, and time for Q&A or co-working.
The Rubin Virtual Data Academy takes place every June and offers an intensive week of hands-on learning.
Recordings are available for past seminars.

Be aware that the `Rubin Users Committee <https://www.lsst.org/scientists/users-committee>`_ advocates on behalf of RSP users.

All delegates are invited to take on additional activities that will **inform and improve RSP development**,
or **extend and enhance the benefits of DP0** within the science community.

Inform and improve the RSP
--------------------------

**Participate in feedback surveys.**
When requested, complete feedback surveys for Rubin Observatory.

Read the results from the `DP0.1 survey <https://community.lsst.org/t/the-dp0-1-feedback-survey-action-items/6105>`__
or the `DP0.2 survey <https://community.lsst.org/t/dp0-2-feedback-survey-action-items/7402>`__.

**Submit bug reports.**
Help with RSP improvements by submitting bug reports via `GitHub issues <https://github.com/rubin-dp0/Support>`__
(see :ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Support-Github`).

**Suggest new features.**
Help with RSP development by suggesting new RSP features via `GitHub issues <https://github.com/rubin-dp0/Support>`__,
or by communicating directly with the Rubin `Users Committee <https://www.lsst.org/scientists/users-committee>`__
to advocate for the tools that you need for your LSST science goals.

**Share your experiences.**
Post about your DP0 investigations in the `Data Preview 0 Community Forum category <https://community.lsst.org/c/support/dp0>`__,
so Rubin Observatory staff can see how users are doing science with the RSP.
Reach out to the Rubin `Users Committee <https://www.lsst.org/scientists/users-committee>`__ and let them
know how DP0 is working for you.


Extend the benefits of DP0 in the science community
---------------------------------------------------

**Join an LSST Science Collaboration.**
There are eight `LSST Science Collaborations <https://www.lsstcorporation.org/science-collaborations>`__, and new members are always welcome.

**Participate in the Rubin Community Forum.**
Ask questions about DP0, or show-and-tell your DP0-related investigations in the `Data Preview 0 Community Forum category <https://community.lsst.org/c/support/dp0>`__.
Respond to questions or discussion topics raised by other DP0 delegates.
This helps to build a global self-supporting network of scientists engaged in LSST research.

**Participate in the DP0 virtual seminars.**
Attend the :ref:`DP0-Delegate-Resources-Virtual-Events` sessions.
Ask questions and join the breakout discussions.
All are welcome to present their DP0-related experiences (contact Melissa Graham).

**Contribute tutorials.**
All delegates are welcome to share their own Jupyter Notebooks using the shared repositories
`delegate-contributions-dp02 <https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp02>`__ or
`delegate-contributions-dp03 <https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp03>`__.
Tutorials for the Portal, API, or command-line can also be contributed to these repos.

**Share your DP0-related work outside of DP0.**
For example, give a seminar about Rubin Observatory and DP0 at your home institution,
give a tutorial about your RSP/DP0 experience in your Science Collaboration,
or publish a paper on your DP0-related work.

LSST Data Preview 0 Documentation
#################################

Data Preview 0 (DP0) is the first of three data previews during the period leading up to the start of Rubin Observatory Operations.

**Goals of DP0:** To serve as an early integration test of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Science Pipelines and the
Rubin Science Platform (RSP) and to enable a limited number of scientists and students to begin early preparations for science with
**simulated** LSST-like data sets.

**DP0 users:** The scientists and students who have RSP accounts and access to the DP0 data sets.

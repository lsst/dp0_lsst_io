LSST Data Preview 0 Documentation
#################################

Data Preview 0 (DP0) is the first of three data previews during the period leading up to the start of Rubin Observatory Operations.

The goals of DP0 are to serve as an early integration test of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Science Pipelines and the
Rubin Science Platform (RSP), and to enable a limited number of scientists and students to begin early preparations for science with the LSST.

**DP0 Delegates** refers to the scientists and students participating in DP0.
This term reflects their important roles of representing the broad science community as learners, testers, and providers of feedback,
and of sharing the benefits of their DP0 participation with their communities as teachers and colleagues.
